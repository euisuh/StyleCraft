# StyleCraft

This repository contains the project submission by **Euisuh Jeong** for the CUDA Advanced Libraries course. 

This Python project leverages the power of deep learning and GPUs to perform image style transfer, a process where the artistic style of one image is applied to the content of another. Utilizing PyTorch and a pre-trained VGG-19 model, the program transforms images by merging the style of one image with the content of another. The script is designed to work efficiently on GPUs, making it suitable for handling high-resolution images. It features functions for image loading, preprocessing, and displaying results, providing a foundation for further customization and exploration in the field of artistic image manipulation. This project is ideal for those interested in computer vision, artificial intelligence, and creative applications of deep learning.
